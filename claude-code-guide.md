# üöÄ Claude Code Implementation Guide
## How to Build Your Financial Tracker with Claude Code

### üìã Prerequisites
- Have Claude Code installed and configured
- The `financial-tracker-spec.md` file (already created)
- A dedicated folder for your project

---

## üéØ Recommended Prompting Strategy

### Step 1: Initial Project Setup
```
"I want to create a personal finance tracking web application. Please read the detailed specification in financial-tracker-spec.md and set up the initial React TypeScript project with the folder structure defined in the spec. Start with Phase 1: Core Foundation."
```

**What Claude Code will do:**
- Create React + TypeScript project
- Set up folder structure
- Install necessary dependencies
- Create base configuration files

---

### Step 2: Data Models and Types
```
"Now implement all the TypeScript interfaces and data models defined in the specification (Expense, Investment, BankAccount, etc.). Create them in src/types/ folder with proper exports."
```

**Expected output:**
- Complete type definitions
- Proper enum types for categories
- Utility types for calculations

---

### Step 3: Storage Layer
```
"Implement the data persistence layer using LocalStorage and IndexedDB (via Dexie.js). Create hooks for CRUD operations for each entity type. Follow the local-first architecture from the spec."
```

**Key points to verify:**
- Data migrations handled
- Backup/restore functionality
- Offline capability

---

### Step 4: Core Components - Iterative Approach

#### 4.1 Expense Tracker
```
"Create the Expense Tracker component with quick entry form, list view, and filters as described in the spec. Focus on mobile-friendly input and Mexican currency formatting."
```

#### 4.2 Investment Manager
```
"Build the Investment Manager specifically for Mexican fintechs (Nu, Didi, MercadoPago). Implement GAT percentage tracking, daily returns calculation, and ROI comparison as specified."
```

#### 4.3 Dashboard
```
"Create the Dashboard with all metric cards and charts defined in the spec. Use Recharts for visualizations. Show Net Worth, Monthly Cash Flow, and Investment Performance."
```

---

### Step 5: Progressive Enhancement
```
"Add PWA capabilities: service worker, offline functionality, and app manifest. Make it installable on mobile devices."
```

---

### Step 6: Export Functionality
```
"Implement Excel export using SheetJS. Create multi-sheet workbooks with Expenses, Investments, Budget, and Reports sheets. Include all formulas for calculations."
```

---

### Step 7: Testing & Refinement
```
"Add comprehensive error handling, data validation, and loading states. Create a simple onboarding flow for first-time users."
```

---

## üí° Pro Tips for Working with Claude Code

### 1. **Be Specific About Mexican Features**
Always emphasize:
- GAT percentage for investments
- Mexican fintech platforms (Nu, Didi, MercadoPago)
- MXN currency formatting
- Spanish labels (but keep code in English)

### 2. **Request Incremental Progress**
Instead of: "Build the entire app"
Better: "Let's start with the expense tracking module, then we'll add investments"

### 3. **Ask for Verification**
After each major component:
```
"Can you verify that the [component] handles these edge cases:
- Empty states
- Large numbers (millions)
- Decimal precision for Mexican pesos
- Offline data sync"
```

### 4. **Request Documentation**
```
"Add JSDoc comments to all calculation functions and create a README with setup instructions"
```

### 5. **Mobile-First Reminders**
Regularly remind:
```
"Make sure this works well on mobile devices with touch interactions and small screens"
```
